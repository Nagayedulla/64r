 HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the core language used to structure content on the web. It organizes text, images, links, and media using tags and elements that browsers can interpret. As of 2025, over 95% of websites rely on HTML alongside CSS and JavaScript, making it a fundamental tool in modern web development.

It is a markup language, not a programming language. This means it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.
It is a static language, meaning it does not inherently provide interactive features but can be combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
In a nutshell, HTML is all about organizing and displaying information on a webpage. We can think of it as the bones or structure of a webpage.</p>

<p>HTML page structure</p>
 This is the document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the document is an HTML5 document.
 This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.
 The head tag contains the "behind the scenes" elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren't visible on the front end of a webpage. Typical elements inside the <head> include:
 Defines the title displayed on the browser tab.
 Provides information like the character set or viewport settings.  </p>

​Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Python offers a wide range of functionalities that make it a popular choice in various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. ​In this article, we'll cover the foundational concepts of Python programming to help you get started.

Writing First Python Program
To begin coding in Python, we'll need to have Python installed on our system. You can download the latest version from the official Python website. Once installed, we can write and execute Python code using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, Vs Code (requires installing Python extension), or even a simple text editor</p>
<h1>python operators</h1>
<tr>
<table>
    <td><p>arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator	Name	Example	Try it
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y	
%	Modulus	x % y	
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	
//	Floor division	x // y</p></td>
</table>
rithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator	Name	Example	Try it
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y
