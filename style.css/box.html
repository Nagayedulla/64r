          Lord Shiva is a principal deity in Hinduism, revered as the destroyer within the Trimurti (Trinity) and the "God of Gods" (Mahadev).

Worshipped by Shaivas, Shiva is depicted in various forms like a meditating yogi, the cosmic dancer Nataraja, and Ardhanarishvara (half-man, half-woman) to represent his multifaceted nature as the supreme power, the source of knowledge, and the protector of his devotees
